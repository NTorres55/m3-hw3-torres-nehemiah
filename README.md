## Issues
1. One of the main issues I had was with Koala. It kept stopping while I was coding and wasn't converting LESS to CSS. I had to restart and eventually reinstall and it stalled me a few hours (part of why this might be late.)
2. Second issue I had was with offsetting the image. I inserted offset-1 on the image in hopes of leaving a 1 column space but it didn't work. Not quite sure what I did wrong.
